			<div><p>Go is an ancient game which, from its forgotten origins in China, spread first to the rest of East Asia, and then to the entire world. How ancient? Historians aren't sure; it has a definite history of over 3000 years, but according to tradition Go was invented more than 4000 years ago. The English name comes from the Japanese name Igo, which means "surrounding boardgame".</p></div>
